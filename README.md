# 🌸 Welcome to my GitHub Profile! 🌸  

Hi! I’m **31 years old**, a student at **HTWK Leipzig**, and a little in love with TypeScript and VueJS. 💻✨  

## 🧸 About Me
- **TypeScript + VueJS** = 🥰 My absolute dream team!  
- **C++**, **C/C#**: We get along well enough, but I’m not ready to invite them to family gatherings just yet. 😅  
- **Java**: ... Well, let’s just say it’s complicated. 😬  

## 🛠️ My Toolkit
- **Coding Stuff**:  
  🟢 TypeScript & VueJS (my heart beats green!)  
  🔵 C++, C/C#
  🔴 Java

  ![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Leeszaa&theme=ambient_gradient&)

- **Other Skills**:  
  🌈 **Blender**: For magical 3D creations (or chaotic attempts).  
  🎨 **Photoshop**: Because pictures can say more than a thousand words.  
  💻 **Visual Studio Code**: My second home.  

- **Game Development Stuff**:  
  🎮 **Rebar & alt:V**: For creating custom game mods and scripting.  
  🚗 **GTA 5 Modeling & MLOs**: Making the world of San Andreas even more immersive one model at a time.  

## 🌼 Fun Facts
- 🌟 I’m a master at turning bugs into features (and sometimes the other way around... oops 🙈).  
- 🌸 I love adding a touch of cuteness to my projects – a tiny 🐾 emoji here and there works wonders!  
- 🌧️ Debugging feels like walking in the rain: frustrating at first, but refreshing in the end.  

## 🐾 When I’m not coding...
- ...you’ll probably find me with a large cup of tea in hand. ☕  
- ...dreaming that my Blender renders will someday look as good as I imagine them. 🌌  
- ...or writing commit messages like: `fix: oops`, `style: ✨ fancy touch ✨`, and `refactor: because I can`. 😇
